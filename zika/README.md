# Capturing the essence of bioinformatics: A case study on the Zika virus genome



## Scenario

Following the emergence of an enigmatic disease and your suspicion of its transmissibility, you requested the sequencing of a collected biological sample. After a period of time, you have now received the results of the sequencing.

## Exercice 1

The class should be divided into two groups, and each group should elect a representative. Take 10 min  to formulate hypotheses and develop a well-defined strategy for conducting the analysis. :clock130:

## Exercise 2
The sequence has been stored in a plain text format in `data/row_sequence.txt`. 

1. Why we use the plain text format for this sequence.
2. Could you find a tool that calculates the size of the  genome from the sequence file 
3. Using ChatGPT (or Google Bard), find out which sequence could be used to store the sequence ðŸ’»
4. Arrange the sequence to include **data** and **metadata**
